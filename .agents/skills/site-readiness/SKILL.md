description: Audit, improve, and verify alexnava.me for release readiness, public AI-agent discoverability, static-hosting security, build health, and rendered behavior. Use when maintaining this repository, preparing a release, updating public content, investigating a site-loading issue, or checking agent-readable files.

# Site readiness

Use the repository source and its existing contracts as the authority. Keep the site static, light, and privacy-preserving; do not introduce a service, framework, deployment, or dependency unless the user specifically asks.

## Maintain the source of truth

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and, for visual changes, `STYLE.md` before editing.
2. Inspect `git status --short` and preserve unrelated changes, generated `dist/`, local review folders, and coordination state.
3. Edit readable source only: `src/`, `index.html`, `styles.css`, root static files, and tests. Never hand-edit `dist/`.

## Keep the public site agent-readable

1. Maintain the public `llms.txt`, `sitemap.md`, and `AGENTS.md` artifacts with only accurate, non-sensitive content.
2. Ensure `build.mjs` copies those artifacts to `dist/`, and give them stable-asset headers in `_headers`.
3. Keep `robots.txt` permissive for citation crawlers unless the user decides otherwise.
4. Keep canonical, Open Graph, and JSON-LD metadata aligned with the actual homepage.
5. Offer Markdown alternatives only when they can remain correct and low-maintenance; do not fabricate a dynamic content-negotiation layer for this static site.

## Verify a change

Run the narrowest relevant checks, then the release set:

```powershell
npm run verify
npm test
npm run audit:ci
npm run build:dist
```

For rendered work, start `npm run preview`, verify the home page and both About and Contact panels at desktop and mobile widths, and check for console errors, overlays, missing assets, broken focus behavior, and clipping. Use the in-app Browser when available. Otherwise, use `Invoke-WebRequest` or `curl` against the local preview for HTTP and asset smoke checks, and report browser-only visual and interaction checks as unverified; do not install Playwright just for a routine check.

## Preserve release boundaries

- Do not deploy, change Cloudflare settings, change DNS, or touch secrets without explicit authorization.
- Treat `_headers`, `_redirects`, and `wrangler.jsonc` as security- and hosting-critical.
- Keep the UI bundle below its tested budget and preserve the deferred Three.js scene split.
- Report only fresh evidence. If a preview or browser surface cannot run, say exactly what remains unverified.
