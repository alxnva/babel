> **Thinking** = not ready to build yet, needs more clarity before it becomes a task.

### Adding to the backlog

Anyone (human or agent) can propose additions. Keep entries to one line. Size is one of: **Small** (< 1 hour), **Medium** (a few hours), **Large** (multi-session), or **Thinking** (needs scoping).

---

## Current positioning

- Audience: creative peers first, broader visitors second
- Site role: sparse personal site, not a full portfolio hub
- Babel role: atmospheric influence, not explicit framing copy
- Public text: stay minimal; prefer small grounding changes over explanatory sections
- Resume: defer until there is a clearer reason to surface it

## Completed tasks

### Production-readiness and calm-interaction pass

**Implemented and regression-tested 2026-07-23.**

- Removed text scramble and random bottom-navigation fire while keeping `Calm by design.` visible at first paint with a restrained positional reveal.
- Clarified the About lead, preserved coarse-pointer labels in short landscape, raised microcopy and contrast floors, made panels scroll-safe, and hid/inerted closing dialogs immediately.
- Extracted tested frame/resize lifecycle helpers; added true reduced-motion dirty rendering with live toggles, corrected touch quality sampling, coalesced no-op resize, target-only developer outlines, fog-aware culling, brazier update gating, stable orbital-buffer uploads, restrained high-tier lighting/bloom, and improved short-landscape framing.
- Added responsive tower posters as the eager scene visual and intentional static fallback for reduced data/motion, unavailable WebGL, and software-rendered WebGL, while retaining live 3D on capable phones and explicit diagnostics.
- Added high-severity dependency gates, hard-threshold Lighthouse runs retained as GitHub Actions artifacts, review-gated preview and main-only production GitHub environments, environment-scoped Cloudflare workflows with the legacy repository-secret fallback retained pending token rotation, retrying content/header smoke checks, a sanitized weekly audit, and an operations/rollback runbook.
- Tightened CSP, aligned HSTS to one year, and separated seven-day stable-asset revalidation from immutable hashed JS/CSS. The attempted Pages-hostname noindex fallback was later removed because Pages `_headers` cannot safely scope rules by hostname; exact-host canonicalization remains a Cloudflare Bulk Redirect task.

### Panel frame unification — re-do as Option A

**Completed 2026-05-05.** The first pass of `ART/last-pass.md` Section 3 shipped a "Plan C" that built neither Option A nor B — it inverted the panel hierarchy by making a Three.js notebook/letter scene the focal element with text crammed into a tiny absolute-positioned overlay. Re-did as actual Option A:

- Both panels now use a single shared `.panel-parchment` frame: same paper treatment, straight (no skew/rotate), same drop-shadow.
- About panel carries a large display "A" watermark (`.panel-parchment__watermark`) sitting behind the text — reads as a tooled cover initial.
- Contact panel carries a CSS-only wax seal (`.panel-parchment__seal`) in the lower-right.
- Text content is once again the focal element, in normal flow with a sensible content column (`max-width: 38ch`).
- Unwired the Three.js panel-object scene (`src/scene/panel-objects.js`) and the canvas panel-asset draw functions (`drawNotebookPanelAsset` / `drawLetterPanelAsset` formerly in `src/ui/icons.js`) — both were detailed creative assets, not scaffolding, so they were **parked** in `src/art/` rather than deleted. Tree-shaking keeps them out of the bundle until something imports them.
- Removed `revealPanelObject` plumbing from `src/ui/panels.js` and `enablePanelObjectFallback` from `src/main.js`.
- Dropped the metaphor-named `--notebook` / `--letter` modifier classes — variant identity now lives in the watermark / seal element each panel carries.
- Updated `test/markup-accessibility.test.mjs` to assert on the new ornament classes and the absence of `panel-object-stage`.

`src/art/` notes:

- `src/art/panel-objects.js` — the original Three.js scene, IIFE-style; re-enable by adding `import "../art/panel-objects.js";` to `src/scene-entry.js`, then call `site.scene.initPanelObjectArt()` and `site.scene.revealPanelObject(panelId)`.
- `src/art/panel-canvas-assets.js` — the two PSX-dither canvas paintings, exposed at `site.art.drawNotebookPanelAsset` / `site.art.drawLetterPanelAsset`. Helpers (fillPoly, applyPsxDither, etc.) are duplicated from `src/ui/icons.js` so the file is self-contained.

### Postprocessing pipeline

**Completed.** Added a restrained global EffectComposer pipeline:

- Added tier-aware color grading, high-tier bloom, and balanced/high vignette + static grain.
- Kept developer-mode OutlinePass as the final interaction-feedback pass.
- Added quality-tier and postprocess factory tests so adaptive profile changes keep pass enablement deterministic.

### Repository reorg to `src/` + `dist/` layout

**Completed.** Landed a large improvements pass:

- Introduced an esbuild build step. Source of truth moved to `src/`; generated bundles now emit into `dist/scripts/` (gitignored).
- Self-hosted Three.js r128 (via the `three` devDependency, emitted to `dist/vendor/three.min.js`).
- Self-hosted Instrument Sans 400/600 and Cormorant Garamond 500/600 as latin-only woff2 subsets under `fonts/`.
- Tightened CSP to `'self'`-only for scripts, styles, fonts; dropped both `'unsafe-inline'` directives.
- Fixed `_headers`: immutable caching for `/scripts/*`, `/vendor/*`, `/fonts/*`; `must-revalidate` for HTML.
- Added `defer` to every `<script>`; removed dead inline scripts and `<noscript>` styles.
- Dropped stale `og:image`/`twitter:image` meta (tracked as backlog item 2).
- Broadened the scene's `lowPower` heuristic and added an `IntersectionObserver` gate on `#home-scene`.
- Rewrote the hero scroll fade to be rAF-driven with a dirty flag.
- Added an offscreen-canvas bitmap cache in `ui/icons.js`, keyed by DPR/state bucket.

### Structural map + phase headers in `main.js`

**Completed.** Added a top-level structural map comment and phase headers inside `initHomeScene()`. Comment-only change — no behavior altered.

### Roadmap foundation truthfulness + social share polish

**Completed.** Tightened the project contract and added the first understated public polish pass:

- Synced repo guidance so `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` all describe the same source-of-truth repo, preview flow, and verification contract.
- Added a Wrangler-backed local preview command so local review is closer to Cloudflare Pages than a plain static file server.
- Added a committed `og.png` asset and restored Open Graph / Twitter image metadata.
- Captured the current internal positioning stance so future copy changes can stay minimal and consistent.

### Cloudflare security baseline hardening

**Completed.** Formalized the static-site security contract and documented the Cloudflare edge assumptions:

- Kept `_headers` as the tracked source of truth for CSP, framing, MIME sniffing, permissions, COOP/CORP, and preload-capable HSTS.
- Added project-contract coverage so the self-only CSP, HSTS preload shape, missing CORS wildcard, and legacy redirect map cannot drift silently.
- Recorded that Cloudflare Web Analytics/RUM injection is disabled by design instead of widening `script-src` for `static.cloudflareinsights.com`.
- Clarified that custom-domain activation, `www` to apex redirects, production `*.pages.dev` handling, DNS/CAA, certificates, WAF, and response transforms remain Cloudflare-side settings to re-confirm before deploy or security mutations.

### Security and deferred-scene performance pass

**Completed.** Applied a focused repo-local polish pass:

- Scoped Cloudflare deploy secrets to only the workflow steps that validate or deploy with Wrangler.
- Split the browser payload into a lightweight UI boot bundle and a deferred Three.js scene bundle loaded after first paint.
- Kept source docs aligned with the generated `scripts/app.HASH.js` plus `scripts/scene.HASH.js` output shape.

### Unified dark gothic loading ritual

**Implemented for preview review.** Added a CSS-driven, 1.1-second homepage entrance that combines
cold fog, an engraved ember-lit tower seal, two restrained braziers, the Alex Nava wordmark, and a
timed brass progress stroke. The ritual is decorative and self-hiding, has reduced-motion and
forced-colors treatments, adds no external asset or dependency, and leaves the responsive poster
and deferred Three.js capability gates unchanged. See `ART/loading-ritual.md`.
