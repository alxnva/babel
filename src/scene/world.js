// Anchored coordinate constants for the Three.js scene.
//
// Convention (ported from dead-signal-3d-draft): positions are feet-anchored.
// FLOOR_Y is the implicit y=0 reference; the procedural ground surface
// (scene.groundHeight) undulates around it. Every fixed spatial value below
// ought to read as an offset, distance, or extent relative to this anchor.
//
// Vector-valued constants are stored as `[x, y, z]` arrays (not THREE.Vector3)
// because the scene IIFEs execute at page load — before three.min.js is
// injected by main.js. Callers construct the Vector3 at use time with
// `new THREE.Vector3(...scene.WORLD.MOON_POSITION)`.
